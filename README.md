# Etch-a-Sketch

Hello There! Hope you are doing well!

This is my Etch-A-Sketch project I did from the open source project, The Odin Project. This creative game was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript skilss we learned in The Odin Project lessons.

Mouse over the default grid size to create a sketch in many different colors or enter a number to create your own grid to sketch to your hearts' content!

NOTE: Not optimized for smaller screens when doing large scale grid sizes. 

Any advice or constructive criticism is really helpful as I always appreciate any feedback to improve my skills.

Huge Thanks to The Odin Project for giving us the lessons and projects they come up with to test and perfect Front-End Web Development skills.

Here are some previews on what the website looks and acts:
